**what are runners?**

A runner is a server or virtual machine that executes your GitHub Actions workflow.

It’s the machine that runs your jobs and steps — executes the code, installs dependencies, runs tests, builds images, and deploys your app.

When your workflow runs, GitHub automatically provisions a runner, executes your job on it, and then tears it down (for hosted runners) — or it runs on your own machine if you use self-hosted runners.
